# 1. What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?

Answer: In TypeScript, both interfaces and types are powerful tools for defining the structure of our data, but they each have their own strengths and uses.

Interfaces:
Defining Objects: Interfaces are great for describing objects and classes. For example, if we want to define what properties an object should have, we can use interface.

Inheritance: we can use interfaces to extend other interfaces, which helps when we want to create more complex structures by building on existing ones.

Merging: One of the special things about interfaces is that if we declare the same interface multiple times, TypeScript will automatically combine them. This is useful when working with libraries or frameworks.

Readability: Interfaces make the code easy to understand when we are working with large projects or teams, as they help describe exactly what data should look like.

Types:
Flexible with Different Types: Types are more flexible and can be used for things beyond just objects. we can define unions intersections and even primitive types like string or number.

Complex Data: Types are perfect when we need to define combinations of different types, like an object that could either be a string or a number.

No Merging: Unlike interfaces, types canot be merged. So if we try to define the same type twice, it will cause an error.

Type Aliases: Types are useful when we want to create a shortcut for more complex data structures. we can create a type alias that makes code easier to manage.

When to Use:
Use interfaces when we want to define how an object or class should look, especially if we might need to extend or merge them.
Use types when we need flexibility to define more complex combinations, like unions, intersections or primitive types.

# 2. What is the use of the keyof keyword in TypeScript? Provide an example.

Answer: The keyof keyword is used to get a union of the keys of an object type. It helps us refer to the names of the properties of an object, and we can use this to make your code more flexible and type safe.

Example:
type Person = {
name: string;
age: number;
job: string;
};
If we use keyof Person, it will give us a union type of all the keys of the Person object, which are name, age and job

keyof usefullness:
It makes our code safer by ensuring us only pass valid property names as arguments.
If the Person type changes the keyof type will automatically update, helping us by prevent errors.

# 3. How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

Answer: TypeScript is a powerful tool that helps developers write safer and more reliable code. One of the main benefits of TypeScript is its ability to catch mistakes early. Since it checks the types of variables, functions, and objects before the code runs, it can warn developers about potential errors that would show up when the program is running. For example, if we try to use a number where a string is expected, TypeScript will alert us about the mistake. This helps prevent bugs that might be difficult to find later. Another great feature of TypeScript is its ability to make the code easier to understand. By using explicit types, TypeScript makes it clear what kind of data a function expects and what it will return. This makes the code easier to read, especially for new team members or when working on large projects. Additionally, TypeScript supports autocompletion, meaning that it can suggest possible variables, methods or properties as we type, saving time and reducing errors. It also helps with refactoring, which is when we change parts of the code without breaking other parts. With TypeScript, we can make changes with confidence, knowing that it will catch any issues related to types. Overall, TypeScript helps improve the quality of code by making it safer, easier to understand, and simpler to maintain, especially as projects grow in size and complexity.
